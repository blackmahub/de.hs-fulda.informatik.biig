This is one of the backend parts of a real estate application that we did as our master coursework named "Global Distributed Software Development" using NodeJS, Express, JQuery, MySQL. The project was developed using MVC architecture.
 
The file "modelProperty.js" contains a model named "Property" that provides services to controller by communicating with database and then give result to controller. 

Here I wrote a dynamic search function using different filter criterias that generates a dynamic sql based on filter criterias and then fetch data from database, finally send the result to the respective controller. 

The name of the function is "search" with its all sub functions.
